# Dashboard Higher Education Ecuador

Developed a dashboard through the lens of an analyst to create a letter to the stakeholders of a University in Ecuador.

The developing of the dashboard considers:
1. Storytelling based on providing a context, challenge, and a conclusion.
2. KPIs related to the higher education sector.
3. Comparison with close competitors to highlight a stronger analysis.
4. Combination of words, charts, and indicators.
5. Focus on Design Thinking, colors and simplicity that allow an easy navigation and dashboard flow.
